Establish the Constitution for a CLI-based Todo application named memory-todo.

Core Principles:

Simplicity: The application must be lightweight and run entirely in the terminal.

State: Use in-memory storage only; no persistent database or file I/O is required for this version.

Clean Code: Follow PEP 8 standards, use type hinting throughout, and ensure modularity.

Tech Stack Constraints:

Language: Python 3.13+

Environment/Package Manager: uv

Development Tools: Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus for spec-driven development.

Project Structure:

Follow a modern Python layout (e.g., src/todo_app/ for logic, tests/ for specs).

Entry point should be via todo_app.main:app
